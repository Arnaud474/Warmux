  * debian/control:

  [ Eddy Petrișor ]
  * fix build issues on gcc-4.3 (Closes: 462566)
    the patch is split in two:
    - one was initialy created for upstream trunk

  * (Description is still not HIG compliant)
  * Add VCS tages in control and move Homepage from description

  [ Eddy Petrișor ]
  * drop using the mis-feature DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL of cdbs
    since it can lead to various issues and is a serious reason for
    REJECTS for NEW packages:
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/08/msg00011.html
    Also see: http://bugs.debian.org/311724
  * to compensate for the previous removal, add a script that does the same
    thing, but needs to be manually ran by the maintainer; added also a
    debian/rules rule that wraps the same script to make its purpose more
    obvious
  * include new upstream release 0.8beta3
    - drop char-int.patch since it was applied upstream
  * build depend explicitly libcurl4-gnutls-dev since:
    - we don't need openssl specific stuff
    - wormux is GPL-ed and linking against openssl would need an exception
  * propagate Barry's changes on control to control.in, too, since they
    would be forgotten on the next debian/control generation
